This is the implementation of a simple Java Virtual Machine.  This is
the final project of the first semester of 2021 of the Basic Software
course of the Computer Science department of the University of Brasilia.

Since the professor uses Microsoft Windows™, he expects all alumni to
write portable ISO C99 code; I cannot use thus the high-quality POSIX
extensions to C, which is such a shame.
